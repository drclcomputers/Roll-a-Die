Roll a die Simulator.

- For Windows:
1. Download and run 'main.exe'
2. Start using it

- For other platforms (Unix-based like Linux or Mac):
 
Note: Because of some errors with my Linux VM, the file I made always gets corrupted when transfered to my host machine so I decided to remove it and leave the user to compile it.
1. Download 'main_unix.cpp'
2. Compile it yourself using g++

If you encounter any errors, download the 'main.cpp' and modify the source code according to your device or start an issue and I'll try to resolve it.

Start Rolling!
